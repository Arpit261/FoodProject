# FoodProject

In this Food project we are used to develop a fully functionally food app 

In this application firstly we use various type of user activities

▪Register Activity

▪Login Activity

▪ Forget Activity

▪ Reset password Activity 

This all  User data we will send to the server using Volley Library (POST REQUEST) and save all the data in the Shared Preference.

How it works??


Firstly when user register a account they will move to the home page all the list of restaurant name fetch from server using VOLLEY LIBRARY(GET REQUEST) and  when the user click the restaurant they will move  to the Restaurantlist then they will select the food  once he 
decided the food which has been order  and click the GO TO CART BUTTON they will move the next activity which CART ACTIVITY  which shows all the food which have you added
in the cart and also they will show the amount in the button(PLACE ORDER) then they show the dialog YOUR ORDER IS SUCCESSFULLY PLACED.

And once the user logout the application next time they will only login the user details (at the time when user register) then they will move to the 
home page.

And also there are more functionalities like Profile Fragment  , Favourite Fragment  and so on...
